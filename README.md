# MLHouseEstimator

* The MLHouseEstimator is a C program designed to implement a one-shot learning algorithm in the Unix environment.
* This program utilizes file input/output, dynamic memory allocation, and effectively implements a moderately complex algorithm.
* The algorithm aims to predict house prices based on specific attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and the year the house was built.
* By finding appropriate weights through training data, the program estimates house prices using the formula y = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4.
* This project provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in programming, file handling, and implementing a basic machine learning technique.
